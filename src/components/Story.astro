  <div class="story-content">
    <p>
      I was born and raised in Carnarvon, a small rural town over 1,000 kilometres
      north of Perth. Growing up there shaped me in many ways, but it also meant
      my opportunities were limited. I wasn’t surrounded by many people with the
      same aspirations I had, particularly the goal of going to university, and
      for a long time, that future felt distant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Late in my schooling, I was given the opportunity to move to Perth and
      attend school there. While this opened doors, it also came with challenges.
      When I first arrived, I felt behind academically and socially, and I was
      consistently failing. It was confronting, but it forced me to make a
      decision: either let the gap consume me, or actively close it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I chose to take every opportunity I could. Through consistency, hard work,
      and a willingness to ask for help, I began to improve. Over time, what once
      felt impossible became achievable and I ultimately exceeded my original high
      school goal by gaining entry into law school.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am now studying a double degree in Law and Commerce at Curtin University,
      driven by a strong passion for accessibility. My own journey has shown me
      how transformative access to education, support, and opportunity can be. I
      believe that when systems are designed to be accessible, they don’t just
      help individuals succeed; they unlock potential that would otherwise be
      lost.

    <p class="emphasis">
      Accessibility, to me isn’t just a principle, it’s personal. And it’s
      something I aim to carry into everything I do.
